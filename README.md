# University Projects Repository

Hi! Welcome to this repository, where you can find some of my coursework and assignments completed during my Computer Science studies at the University of Buenos Aires. The projects are organized by course.

## Contents

- **AED3**  
  Advanced competitive programming problems solved using backtracking, dynamic programming, and advanced graph algorithms (in C++). These solutions are benchmarked and thoroughly explained in a report (.pdf).

- **Ingeniería del Software**  
  Programs developed in Smalltalk, focusing on clean code heuristics and object-oriented design patterns.

- **Métodos Numéricos**  
  - An Optical Character Recognizer implemented in C++ using PCA.  
  - The Loess algorithm for locally weighted multivariate regression.  
  Both projects are extensively documented, experimented upon, and benchmarked (.pdf).

- **Paradigmas de la Programación**  
  Coursework exploring different programming paradigms:  
  - Functional (Haskell)  
  - Object-oriented (JavaScript)  
  - Logical (Prolog)

- **Sistemas Operativos**  
  A game where each player is represented as a system-level process, competing to capture a flag using various strategies. Additionally, a complex data structure was implemented to handle process concurrency. These projects are explained and benchmarked in a detailed report (.pdf).

- **Teoría de las Comunicaciones**  
  Data analysis challenges involving wiretapping networks and tracerouting packets across the globe.

## Organization
Each course directory begins with "TP" (e.g., **Teoría de las Comunicaciones** contains subdirectories **TP1** and **TP2**).
